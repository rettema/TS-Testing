### AEGIS Touchstone Testing TestScript Dynamic Fixture Extension


#### Scope and Usage

This Complex Extension for testscript-dynamic-fixture defines a TestScript fixture where the user will be prompted by the Test Engine for the contents immediately before the test execution. These fixtures will be treated differently from regular fixtures where regular fixtures are validated during testgroup upload and have to be present in the upload or already exist. These fixtures will be pasted in by the test executor on the TestSetup screen.
